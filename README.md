# Description
ATN provides an interface for reading distributed statuses and setting commands to distributed subsystems.  
Itâ€™s helpful to think of ATN as a broker that allows independent subsystems to communicate with each other by publishing and subscribing to certain topics on the broker.  
This may be reminiscent of the MQTT protocol for some, but here it is intended for communication between local processes on a single CPU.  
The core portion of ATN keeps track of the value of each topic, and it allows each Module in the system to publish a new value to that topic, or to subscribe to value changes for that topic.
